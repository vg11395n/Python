# Steps
# 1: import a data saves as a csv
# 2: clean the data e.g. remove duplicates, spaces, special characters etc..
# 3: split the data into training/test sets
# 4: create a model e.g. select algorithm such as decision tree, neural network
# 5: train the model
# 6: make prediction
# 7: evaluate and improve

# Python libraries for machine learning
# 1. Numpy
# 2. Pandas
# 3. MatPlotLib
# 4. Scikit Learn

# We need to install a platform first called Anaconda and then install code editor Jupyter to work with machine learning

import pandas as pd
